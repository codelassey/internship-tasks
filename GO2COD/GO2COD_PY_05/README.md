# Hangman Game with Cybersecurity Terms

This is an implementation of the classic Hangman Game, featuring cybersecurity-related terms as the word list. It was created as the final project during my internship at Go2cod. This project showcases Python fundamentals like loops, conditionals, and lists to create an engaging learning experience.

## Word List

The game uses the following cybersecurity-related terms:
firewall, malware, phishing, ransomware, trojan, spyware, adware,  
encryption, decryption, password, hashing, spoofing, botnet, backdoor,  
honeypot, sandboxing, cyberattack, breach, forensics, keylogger,  
antivirus, patching, cipher, token, rootkit, whitelist, blacklist,  
multifactor, authentication, vulnerability.

## How It Works

1. The program selects a random word from the cybersecurity word list.
2. The player must guess the word by entering one letter at a time.
3. The game ends when:
   - The player guesses the entire word correctly (win condition).
   - The player runs out of attempts (lose condition).

## How to Play

1. Clone this repository or copy the hangman.py file.
2. Run the program using Python 3
3. Follow the instructions displayed on the screen.

## Customization

- Change Word List: Replace the terms in the word_list variable with your own words.

- Adjust Difficulty: Modify the attempts variable to allow more or fewer incorrect guesses.
